# Outlook Checker Extension for Chrome

## About
This Chrome extension was really horribly created by [Sarah Liang](www.linkedin.com/in/sarahliangCS), a CS student at the University of Alabama. The development of this thing was mostly for a learning experience. Obviously, this extension is still very, very rough. Feel free to check out the [Github](https://github.com/smliang/outlook-checker) and maybe a do a better job coding this than me. All in all, this thing is my baby and I'm pretty proud of it. 

## Framework
Since I'm a total noob, plz don't judge me on how this is done. I would've done it 60+ other ways with what I learned along the way, but that's knowledge for the next project. Utilized in this bad boy is:
- html
- vanilla javascript (my biggest regret)
- Microsoft's Fluent UI Packages (mostly for icons, see above point for more reasons to regret)
- Bootstrap 5.0 bc I have a dependency issue and cannot dev without it
- The stackoverflow article "How to center text in a div", which I googled at least three times an hour

## Issues, Bugs, and Suggestions
 I'm expecting this thing to have some bugs, so PLEASE help me out by [**contacting me** at smliang@crimson.ua.edu](https://outlook.office.com/?path=/mail/action/compose&to=smliang@crimson.ua.edu&subject=%5BOUTLOOK%20CHECKER%20BUG%5D) with a description of any issues or feature ideas. Screenshots are appreciated!!


## Credits
I couldn't have figured a lot of this out without predecessors before me, mainly [Jason Savard's amazing Checker Plus for Gmail](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/checker-plus-for-gmail/oeopbcgkkoapgobdbedcemjljbihmemj?hl=en), which was the inspiration for all of this mess in the first place. I've used his extension for so long and when there was no Outlook substitute, that just could not do. I also had to give Kudos to [Levente Szab√≥'s Mail Checker for Outlook](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mail-checker-for-outlook/cjbkbbjggdnlcbomblebkobkleanbmkk?hl=en), which really helped me figure out the groundwork of this extension.
