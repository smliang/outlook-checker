   <h2 id="about">About</h2>
   <p>This Chrome extension was really horribly created with vanilla javascript by <a
         href="www.linkedin.com/in/sarahliangCS">Sarah Liang</a>, a CS student at the University of Alabama. The
      development of this thing was mostly for a learning experience. Obviously, this extension is still very, very
      rough. Feel free to check out the <a href="https://github.com/smliang/outlook-checker">Github</a> and maybe a do a
      better job coding this than me. All in all, this thing is my baby and I&#39;m pretty proud of it. </p>
   <h2 id="credits">Credits</h2>
   <p>I couldn&#39;t have figured a lot of this out without predecessors before me, mainly <a
         href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/checker-plus-for-gmail/oeopbcgkkoapgobdbedcemjljbihmemj?hl=en">Jason
         Savard&#39;s amazing Checker Plus for Gmail</a>, which was the inspiration for all of this mess in the first
      place. I&#39;ve used his extension for so long and when there was no Outlook substitute, that just could not do. I
      also have to give Kudos to <a
         href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mail-checker-for-outlook/cjbkbbjggdnlcbomblebkobkleanbmkk?hl=en">Levente
         Szab√≥'s Mail Checker for Outlook</a>, which really helped me figure out the groundwork of this extension.
