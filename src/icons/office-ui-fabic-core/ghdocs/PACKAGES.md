# Package managers

Fabric is also available from a variety of package managers, including [Bower](https://bower.io/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), and the [NuGet Package Manager](https://www.nuget.org/). You can quickly add Fabric as a package and stay up to date with the latest version.

**Please note** Fabric's core styling now no longer includes the components. In order to get the latest components *and* the core, please check out the Fabric React components on the [main Fabric site](http://dev.office.com/fabric) or the Fabric JS components on the [project's repository](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-js). For information on accessing the previous versions of Fabric that included the components via package managers, check out the [2.6.1 get started docs](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-core/blob/master/ghdocs/261GETSTARTED.md).
