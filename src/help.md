## About
This Chrome extension was really horribly created with vanilla javascript by [Sarah Liang](www.linkedin.com/in/sarahliangCS), a CS student at the University of Alabama. The development of this thing was mostly for a learning experience. Obviously, this extension is still very, very rough. Feel free to check out the [Github](https://github.com/smliang/outlook-checker) and maybe a do a better job coding this than me. All in all, this thing is my baby and I'm pretty proud of it. 



## Credits
I couldn't have figured a lot of this out without predecessors before me, mainly [Jason Savard's amazing Checker Plus for Gmail](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/checker-plus-for-gmail/oeopbcgkkoapgobdbedcemjljbihmemj?hl=en), which was the inspiration for all of this mess in the first place. I've used his extension for so long and when there was no Outlook substitute, that just could not do. I also had to give Kudos to [Levente Szab√≥'s Mail Checker for Outlook](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mail-checker-for-outlook/cjbkbbjggdnlcbomblebkobkleanbmkk?hl=en), which really helped me figure out the groundwork of this extension.
